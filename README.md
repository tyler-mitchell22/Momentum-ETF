# Momentum ETF Strategy

## Overview
This repository is an implementation of a momentum-based ETF strategy that selects stocks from the NYSE based on risk-adjusted momentum. The strategy shows comparable results with the S&P 500 (SPY) from the 2013-2020, and shows significant out performance post-pandemic.

## Strategy Methodology
The strategy follows these key steps:
1. Filters NYSE stocks with market cap > $1B, price > $5, and IPO year â‰¤ 2012
2. Calculates risk-adjusted momentum as (12-month return - 1-month return) / 12-month volatility
3. Rebalances monthly into the top 10 stocks with highest risk-adjusted momentum
4. Equally weights the selected stocks in the portfolio

## Performance Highlights
The strategy delivers exceptional performance metrics:

### 3-Year Performance
- **CAGR**: 16.22%
- **Total Return**: 56.98%
- **Beta**: -0.25 (negative correlation to market)

- **Maximum Drawdown**: -19.76%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.22
- **Sortino Ratio**: 1.52
- **Calmar Ratio**: 0.01

- Strong positive alpha, 13.26% over 3 years, shows significant risk-adjusted outperformance
- The strategy appears to have evolved substantially over time, with the inception beta of 1.18 showing initial market correlation
- Despite similar volatility profiles over both time periods, the strategy has achieved significantly higher returns in the recent 3-year window
